<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>
    The Home folder on your Mac contains a number of folders -- Applications, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Movies,
    Music, Pictures, Public -- that you'll likely access frequently. But strangely, the Home folder is hard to find the
    in Finder by default. I'll show you how to find your Home folder and add it to Finder's sidebar for quick and easy
    access.
    'Home' is actually your user folder
    The first thing you should know about the Home folder is that it's not named Home. It features a home icon, but its
    title is the name you chose for your user account. It lives in the Users folder (along with any guest folders if you
    created additional user profiles).
